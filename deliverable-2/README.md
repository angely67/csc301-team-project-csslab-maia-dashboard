# Maia Dashboard / anti-semicolon-semicolon-club



## Description 
We are developing an educational, easy-to-use, and aesthetically pleasing dashboard where users can review and reflect on their past chess games.

Currently, there are a few chess analyzers in use; however, they all provide feedback based on superhuman engines, such as Stockfish. These AI use complex algorithms to find the globally optimized moves, which is difficult for our human users to interpret and learn.

Our dashboard will be using the [Maia Chess](https://maiachess.com/), the chess engine introduced by our client, [CSSLab](http://csslab.cs.toronto.edu/). Maia is much better at predicting human moves than existing engines. This ability allows Maia to not only offer more relevant and easier to understand suggestions; but also find sets of interesting, tricky, or suboptimal moves (we refer to them as states) to reinforce learning. Our dashboard will be a platform that utilizes the full capability of Maia to list these chess states of interest from usersâ€™ past chess games on the [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) server. We will recreate these states on the chessboard, and we will use arrows and highlighting to show better moves or why a state is interesting.

**Maia Dashboard API docs:** http://dashboard.maiachess.com/api/docs 

## Key Features

For this deliverable, below is the complete set of features an user can access. 

Note that these features are connected with the backend: the frontend receives stubbed data from the backend via API. It was confirmed with the TA that stubbing the data is ok for Deliverable-2.
* Searching for interesting moves ([User Story #4](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V2gnUiMgze4BJ1yaO9ueb0veCmzg0P37orXA-_0MsZc/edit#slide=id.gf59b00164d_0_72))
  * After selecting "interesting" in the filter column, the page will search for interesting moves and display the result under the positions column.
* Searching for tricky moves ([User Story #3](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V2gnUiMgze4BJ1yaO9ueb0veCmzg0P37orXA-_0MsZc/edit#slide=id.gf59b00164d_0_65))
  * After selecting "tricky" in the filter column, the page will search for tricky moves and display the result under the positions column.
* Searching for mistakes ([User Story #2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V2gnUiMgze4BJ1yaO9ueb0veCmzg0P37orXA-_0MsZc/edit#slide=id.gf59b00164d_0_100))
  * After selecting "mistakes" in the filter column, the page will search for mistakes moves and display the result under the positions column.
* Viewing a board state on the chessboard
  * The user can choose to view any of the board states by clicking on it. The state will then display on the chessboard.
* Viewing suggestions from the AIs
  * When a board state is displayed on the chessboard, arrows representing the suggestions by the AIs will be displayed as well. Each color represents the suggested move from a different AI.
  
## Instructions
1. Go to the Maia Dashboard website http://dashboard.maiachess.com/ <br />
![Webpage](./images/webpage.png)
2. Select a filter you are interested in by click on one of the options.<br />
![select filter](./images/select_filter.png)
3. Now a list of board states from games played with the maia1 bot will be displayed under the positions column. Click on one from the list that you are interested to have a better look at.<br />
![select state](./images/select_state.png)
4. The game and state of the game is now displayed on the chessboard. Arrows representing the moves that the AIs suggests are also displayed on the chessboard.<br />

**NOTE:** The frontend is not responsive for Deliverable-2 because this was not a priority as defined with the partner. 
Making the frontend responsive is planned for future deliverables.

### Testing the Backend API
**Maia Dashboard API docs:** http://dashboard.maiachess.com/api/docs 

The easiest (and recommended) way to test the Maia Dashboard REST API is to use the link above to make API calls.

The API is separated into `frontend`, `dashboard`, and `analysis` sections. 
The `frontend` API is separated from the `dashboard` and `analysis` API to prevent the frontend from contacting [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) or the Maia Dashboard database directly for security reasons.
The `dashboard` and `analysis` API are implemented separately to allow the Partner to use their functionality separately in the future. 
Because other Maia services might already have the data necessary for analysis, they will contact the `analysis` API directly, skipping the `dashboard` API.


* `frontend` API

Frontend connects to the `frontend` section of the API (please see the [API documentation](http://dashboard.maiachess.com/api/docs#/frontend)) 
to pull the games and analysis data provided by the `dashboard` and `analysis` API. 
Currently, `frontend` API uses stabbed data instead of calling the `dashboard` and `analysis` API, which will be implemented in future deliverables.

* `dashboard` API

The `dashboard` API is responsible for fetching user data and user games from [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) and updating user data in the Maia Dashboard database.

Please find instructions for testing the `dashboard` API below.

* `analysis` API

The `analysis` API is responsible for analysing chess games using the logic provided by the partner and returning analysis results.
This API is not implemented for Deliverable-2 because it requires an analysis logic from the partner, which is still a work in progress.
The `analysis` API was not a priority for Deliverable-2 and will be implemented in future deliverables. <br>

#### Dashboard API Testing Guideline

The Dashboard API showcases ability to get & write data to the backend, as well as search 
for users, register users, login to Lichess via OAuth, and pull Lichess games and profiles in real time. 

**Below are example ways to call the API. Feel free to use any other inputs you wish** <br>

*Posting Events*: The frontend can post any event they want for user logging. See an example below
![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/S7C3SPangUjKCR6A61/source.gif) <br>

*Pulling Lichess User Profiles:* Request a user profile from Lichess and see all their stats. Maia1 (Partner account) is pulled below.
![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/rTC4B3jV5b0wT2czC8/source.gif) <br>

*Adding a User:* Add a user to the database after the've been registered into the Maia system. Try registering a user that already exists for yourself :D 
![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/0WLhps0d953nCO1tLO/source.gif) <br>

*Get User Data:* Pulls user data from the database
![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/5S6UCAdWGV7aPw2rb8/source.gif) <br>

*Lichess OAuth:* Users can login via. Lichess OAuth given they grab a key from their Lichess account. This speeds up game downloads. Team members account used below. ([User Story #1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V2gnUiMgze4BJ1yaO9ueb0veCmzg0P37orXA-_0MsZc/edit#slide=id.gf59b00164d_0_52))<br> 
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/qX49VgsWcDCfJideXU/giphy.gif" width="1000" height="600"> <br>

*Logout:* This method "logs out" the user. Stubbed for now as we don't have official Maia accounts as of yet.

## Development requirements
## Local environment installation guidelines
### Dependencies
In order to run this you need the following installed:
* docker
* python3.8
* virtualenv

### Clone project
Clone the project repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:csc301-fall-2021/team-project-4-csslab-uoft.git
```

### Create virtualenv
Follow instructions in `scripts/setup_local.sh` - run them from the project's top directory.

### Running mongodb container 
Install Docker and run from the top directory of the project:
```
docker-compose up
```
To test that it works, go to `http://localhost:27017` in your browser,
You should see a message: `It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.`.

If you do not see this message, something is wrong starting mongodb container.

If you want to reset the local mongo database: 
1. Terminate the `docker-compose` process.
2. Delete all files from `mongo_data` using this command:
   ```
   rm -rf mongo_data/*
   ```
   Notice there is a hidden file `.gitkeep` so the directory will be created when pulling from git - 
   Do not delete this file.

### Running backend
You can either run the server from the command line using this command from the `backend` directory:
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Or alternatively, you can run the `main.py` using your IDE.
If you wish to change the port the app is running on, you can change this line in `main.py`
```
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000) # << Change port
```

If you want your FastAPI to point to a different mongo database, you 
can set an environment variable `MONGODB_URL` to where you have your mongodb instance.

To check that your backend works, go to `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` - you should see the 
FastAPI openapi doc.

### Running frontend

From the `frontend` directory, run 
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the react app locally. 

 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Before starting development our team agreed on a set of rules for working together. 
![GIT Guidelines](./images/slack_git_guidelines.png)

### Development environment deployment process 
We chose to adapt the following deployment process to recreate the best practices 
that we have seen in the IT industry during our co-op terms and full-time jobs 
as software developers, project managers and system analysts.

We believe in preventing conflicts by communicating with each other; 
our workflow is set to make each developer's working process as transparent as possible to other team members.
* Before starting developing we created a backlog of tasks in Trello 
and chose tickets for Deliverable-2 together with the partner.
![Trello](./images/trello.png)
* When a developer is assigned to a new task, she/he clarifies task requirements written in a Trello ticket.
* When a developer starts working on a new task, she/he moves the Trello ticket for this task to `IN DEV` column.
* The developer pulls updates from the `develop` branch: `git pull --rebase`
* The developer creates and checkouts a new branch for the task: 
```
git branch NEW-BRANCH
git checkout NEW-BRANCH
```
* While implementing the new functionality, the developer adds tests for it.
* Before creating a Pull Request the developer runs all tests to ensure that their code did not break any other functionality.
* When the new functionality is finalized and all tests pass, the developer creates a Pull Request from their branch `NEW-BRANCH` to `develop` branch.
* The developer assigns two reviewers to their Pull Request (other two frontend devs or other two backend devs) and moves the ticket to `WAITING FOR QA` column in Trello.
* Within 48h the reviewers should give their feedback on the Pull Request. 
While a developer is reviewing other developer's Pull Request, they move the Trello ticket to the `IN QA` column. 
* After receiving a code review feedback, the developer fixes their code in accordance with the review comments.
* The developer checkouts `develop` branch into their branch `NEW-BRANCH` and runs tests to make sure that everything still works 
(there might have been changes in the `develop` branch while the developer was working on their ticket).
* The developer merges their branch `NEW-BRANCH` to `develop` branch.
* The developer checks that GitHub Actions have passed.
* The developer checks that their feature is deployed to the [development environment](http://dash-dev.maiachess.com/) and works well there.
* The developer deletes their `NEW-BRANCH` branch from GitHub and moves the Trello ticket to the `DONE` column.


### Production environment deployment process 
Once in a few days Natalia (or another developer) merges `develop` branch into `main` branch 
and checks that all functionality works well in the [production environment](http://dashboard.maiachess.com/).

### CI/CD
During the Deliverable-1 we planned the CI/CD pipeline flow. 
We implemented the CI/CD as planned, using GitHub Actions and Azure hosting provided by the partner.

The only difference is that we used `uvicorn` instead of `gunicorn` service.

The following diagram was created for Deliverable-1 and used as a guideline for CI/CD development during Deliverable-2.
